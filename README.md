____**[OPEN] Experienced Programmer For Hire**____

Hi, I'm Luiz (Hiasei), a 15-year-old Brazilian programmer who has been improving.

I have created my portfolio where I have showcased some of my best coding projects and open source contributions. 

I'm proficient in English and can work from 12:15 PM - 4 PM. I have been passionate about computer programming since 2017, and prior to that, I had been playing Roblox since 2016.

I'm looking for potential opportunities to gain more experience in the field and to develop my skills further. Feel free to take a look at my portfolio and contact me if you think I'd be a suitable fit for any project or job openings you may have.
