____**[OPEN] Experienced Programmer For Hire**____

Hello, my name is Luiz (Hiasei), and I'm a Brazilian programmer with extensive experience in Lua and some knowledge in Python. My focus is on creating unique abilities and attacks, as well as complex systems that enhance gameplay. I have a passion for game development and want to help make games even more amazing.

In my portfolio, you will find some of the projects I've worked on and open-source contributions. I also use Trello for communication and organization while working in a team. I'm available to work from 12:15 PM to 4 PM, and I'm looking for challenging projects where I can apply my skills and knowledge.

My work routine consists of working 4 hours per day, but I guarantee that during that time, I will be fully dedicated to producing the best possible work. I enjoy working in a team, learning new things, and facing challenges, so I'm always seeking new opportunities to improve my skills and experiences.

If you need someone who can create unique abilities and attacks, as well as complex systems in your games, feel free to contact me. I'm excited to be a part of new projects and help take the gaming experience to the next level!
